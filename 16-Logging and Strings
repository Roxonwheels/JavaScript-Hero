Now we want to practice logging together with string concatenation.
Exercise
Write a function shout that takes a string and returns this string duplicated. In addition, the return should be logged.

Example: shout('Fire') should return 'FireFire' and should log 'FireFire'.

SOLUTION

function shout(x){
let duplo = x+x;
console.log(duplo);
return duplo}
